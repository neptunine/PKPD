## Save Xheese

This project is about an educational game based on the famous classic (Hangman).

We thought of the idea behind Hangman is a bit violent and uncanny for the public, 
so instead we thought of alternative characters and objects to be more attractive to the public 
and stay original.

The game would be starring a main character named “Xheese” - a happy and friendly cheese 
that has been put into a jar by naughty villains for experiment. 
To save the cheese, user would have to guess the word sent by the villains within 7 tries, 
with each failed try, the water level in the jar rises, and it worries the Xheese!
After 7 tries, Xheese would be overflown out of the jar! 
Although saved, but Xheese is now hurt and be recaptured!

There will be different word genres to choose from, to suit the user’s preferences. 
Whether they wanted to learn scientific, computing, food words... 
We have them, and could be easily added more later down the line.
